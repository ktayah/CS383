## Running this program

Make sure libraries are installed.
To run the gradient descent algorithm use for problem 2, run `python problem2.py`
To run the linear regression for problem 3, run `python problem3.py`.
NOTE: Problem 3 needs to be manually adjusted to use different pre-processing methods in main(), also there is code below this call that needs to match the respective call, see the comments in the code for details.
